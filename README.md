This repository contains files for Nasa's Ingenuity Rover Linear Modelling project. Abaqus file contains the simulation results under worst case loading of the main beam of the rover. Python file solves derived FEM equations with an option to vary element number. By reiteration of element numbers, we are able perform a convergence study where we can observe the optimum number of elements.
